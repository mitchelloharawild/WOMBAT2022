<h2> Effective Data Visualisation with R </h2>

<br>


<p> In this 3 hour tutorial, I will demonstrate some cognitive principles and apply methods supported by empirical studies that make data visualisation more effective. The construction of data visualisation will be accompanied with R code using the ggplot2 package. The R code and data used will be provided so participants can fully replicate the presented data visualisations.

<p> Emi Tanaka is a Senior Lecturer in Statistics at Monash University and the incoming President of SSA Vic. She is currently working on a statistical theory for conducting inference using data plots and is an early career researcher in multi-level modelling, and experimental design. She is an experienced and enthusiastic R user and instructor, and regularly teaches university courses and workshops to the broader community on data visualisation, including ggplot2.

Some knowledge in tidyverse would be beneficial. You can find an interactive introduction to data analysis with R at <a href="https://learnr.numbat.space/"> https://learnr.numbat.space/ </a>.
