<h2> Exploratory time series analysis using R </h2>

<br>


<p> Many organisations collect huge amounts of data over time, and we need time series analysis tools capable of handling the scale, frequency and structure of the data collected. In this workshop, we will look at some R packages and methods that have been developed to handle the analysis of large collections of time series. We will look at the tsibble data structure for flexibly managing collections of related time series, and consider how to do data wrangling, data visualisation, and exploratory data analysis to analyse time series data in high dimensions.

<ul>
   <li> <strong> Session 1: How to wrangle time series data with familiar tidy tools. </strong> </li>
   <li> <strong> Session 2: How to visualize the trend and seasonal patterns in individual time series. </strong> </li>
   <li> <strong> Session 3: How to compute time series features and visualize large collections of time series. </strong> </li>
</ul>

Attendees are expected to be familiar with R, and with the tidyverse collection of packages including dplyr and ggplot2. They will need to have R and RStudio installed on their own device, and have installed the fpp3 package.
